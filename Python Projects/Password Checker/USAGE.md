# Password Strength Checker by Benton Anestal :lock: :key:

Welcome to my **Password Strength Checker**, a simple yet effective Python-based password security assessment tool! :sparkles: This program checks the strength of your password based on a variety of factors and provides a score out of 5. A higher score indicates a more secure password. This project demonstrates my ability to not only to code but to use coding for security reasons. This project integrates concepts of cybersecurity and advanced concepts of python such as file handling and more!

## Features :star2:

Password Strength Checker ensures your password:
1. :abcd: Contains more than 12 characters
2. :capital_abcd: Includes both uppercase and lowercase characters
3. :1234: Has numbers
4. :symbols: Includes special symbols
5. :busts_in_silhouette: Is not a commonly used password (uses a large text file from SecList repository and checks if entered password exists there!)

The final score will be out of 5, each functionality adds a point, while having a common password will reduce the score by one.

## Usage :computer:
